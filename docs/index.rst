####################

.. warning:: **Deprecation Notice**

             Ansible 2.1 ships with great new networking
             `modules <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_network_modules.html#eos>`_
             purpose-built for Arista EOS. Due to the easy-to-use nature of these modules,
             and their great flexibility, it is no longer recommended to use the arista.eos
             role.

             Get started by checking out the `Arista solution <https://www.ansible.com/ansible-arista-networks>`_
