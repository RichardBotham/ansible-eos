To use the test harness in a local environment, simply update the eapi.conf
file found in test/fixtures with credentials for your local system.  You can
add more than one entry to test multiple EOS nodes at the same time.

The test harness will load the test/fixtures/eapi.conf file and execute the
series of tests as defined in the test cases.  This test harness requires
that the ansible executable is in the current path and that eAPI is enabled 
with an HTTP transport using --connection local

To use the system test harness you need to have nose tests installed on 
your local system

$ pip install nose

Then from the root folder execute nosetests -v
